# sefaria-connections

## About
This project was designed using [Sefaria.org's](https://www.sefaria.org/?home) api and D3.js
to show second degree connections between texts.
That is, not just where one text is linked to a second text,
but also texts that the second text links to.
This allows a user to discover if texts talking talking about a text aggregate around other texts.

As an example, `Any time Amos 1:1 is referenced in a/the Commentary which in turn references a/the Tanakh` yields:

![II Kings 3:4](./II_Kings_34.png)

When Rashi and Abarbanel talk about Amos 1:1 they also mention II Kings 3:4, and when Metzudat David talks about II Kings 3:4, Amos 1:1 is also mentioned. This is because of the use of נֹקֵד 'sheep breeder' in both texts.
